## Linter

Tslint needs to be installed globally: `npm install -g tslint`
When using Visual Code, install the tslint addon to have a instant-linter when writing code.
Other IDE's should have a similar addon.
Alternatively, you can run `ng lint` to check for linting errors.
The linter checks that lines are consistently indented. However it doesn't checks for indent spaces.
The indent space will be 2 spaces.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
